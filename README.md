These files include the code for generating a pair of stylized stacked bar graphs featured in a new [*Socius* paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23780231221094752) with Abdallah Chilungo, Huimeng Zhao, jimi adams, & Sara Yeatman.

TLT data are publicly available to researchers through Data Sharing for Demographic Research: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/DSDR/series/767

The excel file displays the tabulated data from the random men’s sample (Baseline Wave, 2009) on which the published figure is based. 

The do file generates the published version of the visualization. The do file can also be run on women’s data from 2009 (baseline) or 2015 (TLT-2) or on male-partner or random-men samples from Baseline (2009) or 2015 (TLT-2).
